# Pomodorus: A Modern Alarm & Pause System

Pomodorus is a sleek, web-based alarm clock that goes beyond simple wake-up calls. It allows you to define specific "pause" periods throughout your day, either by duration or end time, making it ideal for managing work/break intervals, mindful interruptions, or even just scheduling your daily routines.

## Features

* **Real-time Clock Display:** Always see the current time at a glance.
* **Intuitive Pause Configuration:** Set new pauses through a user-friendly, multi-step modal interface.
* **Flexible Pause Definition:** Define pauses by their **duration** (e.g., "1 hour 30 minutes") or by a specific **end time** (e.g., "end at 17:00").
* **Interactive Time Carousels:** Modern, scrollable carousels for easy hour and minute selection, offering a more engaging experience than standard dropdowns.
* **Daily Repetition:** Mark any pause to repeat daily.
* **Persistent Storage with GitHub Gist:** For daily repeating pauses, your configurations are securely saved and loaded from a private GitHub Gist, ensuring your schedule is maintained across sessions and devices.
* **Desktop Notifications:** Receive timely notifications when a pause starts and ends, even if the browser window isn't in focus.
* **Active Pauses List:** A clear overview of all your configured pauses, with the ability to remove them individually.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** A responsive and aesthetically pleasing design built with plain HTML and CSS, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## How to Use

1.  **Open Pomodorus:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  **Set a New Pause:**
    * Click the "**Configurar Nova Pausa**" (Configure New Pause) button.
    * In the first modal, use the carousels to select the **start time** for your pause, then click "Avançar" (Next).
    * In the second modal, choose whether to define the pause by "**Duração da pausa**" (Pause duration) or "**Hora de término**" (End time). Adjust the hours and minutes accordingly using the carousels.
    * If you want this pause to repeat every day, check the "**Repetição Diária (requer Gist)**" (Daily Repetition (requires Gist)) checkbox.
    * Click "**Definir Pausa**" (Define Pause) to save your configuration.
3.  **Manage Gist (for Daily Pauses):**
    * Click the "**Carregar/Salvar Pausas (Gist)**" (Load/Save Pauses (Gist)) button.
    * Enter your **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** and the **ID of your Gist**.
        * **Creating a PAT:** Go to your GitHub settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Pomodorus Gist Access") and grant it **`gist` scope (read and write access to gists)**.
        * **Creating a Gist:** Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/), create a new secret gist (or public, if you prefer, but secret is recommended), and copy its ID from the URL (e.g., `https://gist.github.com/yourusername/**gistid**`). The file name inside the gist doesn't matter, but it should be named something like `pausas.json` for clarity.
    * Click "**Salvar e Carregar**" (Save and Load) to store your credentials locally and attempt to load any existing daily pauses from your Gist.
4.  **Remove a Pause:** Click the "**Remover**" (Remove) button next to any active pause in the list.
